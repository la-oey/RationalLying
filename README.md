# RationalLying


## Experiment 1

How do liars and lie detectors use (recursive) social reasoning to generate and detect lies?
3x2 condition (20%, 50%, 80% base rate, red vs blue payoff for sender)

- 100 rounds
- Getting caught lying is always -5 for liar and +5 reward for detector; false accusation penalty is always reported - 5
- Feedback about players' scores every fifth trial (no feedback)
- Between subject manipulation to base rate (p_red = {0.2, 0.5, 0.8})
- Artificially inflated rate of marbles drawn and reported: Marble drawing sampled from uniform-binomial mixture distribution

This repo contains the model, experiment (redpayoff, bluepayoff) and analyses.




## Experiment 2

Can liars adjust their lies to detectors' beliefs rather than liars' own beliefs?
3x3 within-subject condition (20%, 50%, 80% sender base-rate & 20%, 50%, 80% receiver base-rate)
